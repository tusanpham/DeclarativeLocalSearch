This test exercises problems with filenames containing multiple periods.
The tex, bib, and image files all have more than one dot.  The tex and bib
files should be handled properly.  In general, the image file is not.
CMake should handle this image correctly in that it is correctly
copied/converted to the build directory.  However, many distributions of
LaTeX do not handle these images correctly.

The tex file links in the image using its full name as an eps file.  That
seems to work for my distribution, which has been picky about all other
configurations, when making a dvi file.  If the LaTeX build fails, that may
not be an actual problem with UseLATEX.cmake.
