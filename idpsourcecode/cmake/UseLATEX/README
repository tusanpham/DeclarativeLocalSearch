Compiling LaTeX files into readable documents is actually a very involved
process.  Although CMake comes with FindLATEX.cmake, it does nothing for
you other than find the commands associated with LaTeX.  I like using CMake
to build my LaTeX documents, but creating targets to do it is actually a
pain.  Thus, I've compiled a bunch of macros that help me create targets in
CMake into a file I call "UseLATEX.cmake".  Here
are some of the things UseLATEX.cmake handles:

* Runs LaTeX multiple times to resolve links.

* Can run bibtex, makeindex, and makeglossaries to make bibliographies,
  indexes, and/or glossaries.

* Optionally runs configure on your latex files to replace @VARIABLE@ with
  the equivalent CMake variable.

* Automatically finds png, jpeg, eps, and pdf files and converts them to
  formats latex and pdflatex understand.

This repository contains the CMake macros in the UseLATEX.cmake file.  To
get started, copy this file to your own LaTeX project and include it in
your build process.

You will also find a LaTeX document, UseLATEX.tex, that contains all of the
documentation for UseLATEX.cmake.  You will also find a CMake build file,
CMakeLists.txt, that uses UseLATEX.cmake to build UseLATEX.tex.  It also
serves as a good example for using UseLATEX.cmake.

You can find the latest information on UseLATEX.cmake on the CMake Wiki at
the following URL.
